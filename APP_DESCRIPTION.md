## 🎓 Educational Description

### What is PalTrade?

**PalTrade** is a companion desktop application overlay designed for Palworld
players who want to trade Pals efficiently without interrupting gameplay.

Think of it like having a trading terminal that floats on top of your game.
Instead of switching windows, opening your browser, and managing listings on
a website, everything happens right there in-game with a simple interface.

**The Problem It Solves:**

- Players want to trade Pals but current methods require alt-tabbing
- Finding trusted traders is difficult
- Managing multiple offers gets overwhelming
- No standardized pricing or market data
- Many third-party sites feel unsafe

**The Solution:**
An elegant overlay that:

- Integrates seamlessly with Palworld UI
- Provides one-click listing and offer management
- Uses secure OAuth authentication
- Connects to a trusted backend platform
- Never shows ads or tracks personal data

**For Different Player Types:**

_Casual Traders_
"I just want to trade some extra Pals. PalTrade makes it dead simple."

_Power Traders_
"I manage 100+ listings. PalTrade's quick-list feature saves me hours every week."

_Content Creators_
"I showcase Pals on stream. PalTrade lets me demonstrate trades in real-time."
